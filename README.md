# iconstash

I was looking for a self-hosted solution to host/store/organize my icons, but didn't find anything.  
So I decided to throw myself head-first into learning Node, JavaScript, React and whatever else that would turn up during the learning process.  
This repository is the result of those couple of days.



Usage :  

     cd client  
     npm install  
     npm run build        
     cd ../server  
     npm install  
     npm run server  
   
This runs the "production" version.  


To run the development-server with hot reloading and all that, change into the "server" directory and run :  

     npm start  

Note : This uses Nodemon and Concurrently
